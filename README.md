# DAA_tsp
The project is to implement TSP using approximation algorithm approach and by dynamic programming approach. Once implemented compare the result of approximate algorithm  with the dynamic solution.
The graph is assumed to be of seven vertices and 12 edges.
Files included are - 
ApproxAlgo.java , Graph.java , Main_Approx.java are the files for 2-approximation algorithm .
Travelling_salesman_problem.java is for the dynamic approach.
Compare.java is used to compare the results obtained.
